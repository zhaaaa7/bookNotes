## DHTML
DHTML is short for Dynamic HTML. Not a technology in and of itself, DHTML is a shorthand term for describing the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The thinking behind DHTML went like this:
• You could use HTML to mark up your web page into elements.
• You could use CSS to style and position those elements.
• You could use JavaScript to manipulate and change those styles on the fly.

While the browser manufacturers simply wanted some way to manipulate web pages with JavaScript, the W3C proposed a model that could be used by any programming language to manipulate any document written in any markup language.

### Dom
In short, the DOM is a way of conceptualizing the contents of a document.

The DOM is what’s known as an application programming interface (API). APIs are essentially conventions that are agreed upon by mutual consent.

In the world of programming, there are many different languages, but there are many similar tasks. That’s why APIs are so handy. Once you know the standard, you can apply it in many different environments. The syntax may change depending on the language you’re using, but the convention remains the same.

In fact, what binds (X)HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together is the DOM. So, let’s use a more accurate term to describe this process: DOM scripting. This refers to the manipulation of documents and style sheets using the W3C DOM. 


### compiler and interpreter
Programming languages are either interpreted or compiled. Languages like Java or C++ require a compiler. A compiler is a program that translates the source code written in a high-level language like Java into a file that can be executed directly by a computer.

Interpreted languages don’t require a compiler—they just need an interpreter instead. With JavaScript, in the context of the World Wide Web, the web browser does the interpreting. The JavaScript interpreter in the browser executes the code directly from the source. Without the interpreter, the JavaScript code would never be executed.

If there are any errors in the code written in a compiled language, those errors will pop up when the code is compiled. In the case of an interpreted language, errors won’t become apparent until the interpreter executes the code.

### weakly typing language
JavaScript makes no distinction in how they are declared or assigned. Some other languages demand that when a variable is declared, its data type is also declared. This is called typing.

Programming languages that require explicit typing are called strongly typed languages. Because typing is not required in JavaScript, it is a weakly typed language. This means that you can change the data type of a variable at any stage.
